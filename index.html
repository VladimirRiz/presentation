					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional
						system,
						meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional
						system.
						You
						work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid
						Container)
						and to that element’s children (which become Grid Items).</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do
						nothing
						less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been
						used
						to lay out our web pages, but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then
						floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left
						out a
						lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance).
					</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Flexbox helped out, but it’s
						intended for simpler one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Grid
						actually work very well together). Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to
						solve
						the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making
						websites.</p>

					<h2>Basics and Browser Support</h2>
					<p>As of March 2017, most browsers shipped native, unprefixed support for CSS Grid: Chrome
						(including on Android), Firefox, Safari (including on iOS), and Opera. Internet Explorer 10 and
						11 on the other hand support it, but it’s an old implementation with an outdated syntax. The
						time to build with grid is now!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the
						column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its child
						elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>This browser support data is from <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid"
							target="_blank">Caniuse</a>
						,
						which has more detail. A number indicates that browser supports the feature at that version and
						up.

					<h2>Important Terminology</h2>
					<p>
						Before diving into the concepts of Grid it’s important to understand the terminology. Since the
						terms involved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it’s easy to confuse them with one
						another if you don’t first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification. But don’t
						worry, there aren’t many of them.

					<h3>Grid Container</h3>
					<p>The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items. In
						this example container is the grid container.</p>
					<pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
						<div class="container">
							<div class="item item-1"> </div>
							<div class="item item-2"> </div>
							<div class="item item-3"> </div>
						  </div>
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section data-auto-animate>
					<h3>Grid Item</h3>
					<p>The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container. Here the item elements are grid
						items, but sub-item isn’t.</p>
					<pre data-id="code-animation"><code class="hljs" data-trim data-line-numbers>
						<div class="container">
							<div class="item"> </div>
							<div class="item">
							  <p class="sub-item"> </p>
							</div>
							<div class="item"> </div>
						  </div>
					</code></pre>

					<h3>Grid Line
					</h3>
					<p>
						The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column
						grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column. Here
						the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Grid Cell</h3>
					<p>
						The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines. It’s a single “unit” of
						the grid. Here’s the grid cell between row grid lines 1 and 2, and column grid lines 2 and 3.
					</p>

						style="height: 180px; margin: 0 auto 4rem auto; background: transparent;">
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Grid Track
					</h3>
					<p>The space between two adjacent grid lines. You can think of them like the columns or rows of the
						grid. Here’s the grid track between the second and third row grid lines.</p>
					<img src="./image/terms-grid-track.svg" alt=""
						style="height: 180px; margin: 0 auto 4rem auto; background: transparent;">
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Grid Area
					</h3>
					<p>The total space surrounded by four grid lines. A grid area may be composed of any number of grid
						cells. Here’s the grid area between row grid lines 1 and 3, and column grid lines 1 and 3.</p>
